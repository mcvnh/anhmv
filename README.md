# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am a curious guy, I love exploring history, life, and myself. I build software for living. I practice Kendo and Wingchun as my pastime.

Things I am playing around:

- [![Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)] - I used to try to make Emacs as my main development tool, but now I am using Visual Studio Code, but still keep Emacs as my notes management.
- [![Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)] - It always easy to access my ebook library over the world, on any devices, or simply convert and send to my kindle with one click.
- [![Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)] - Caddy is awesome, I don't need to setup a complex Nginx server, with lots of configuration, just to proxy my private things outside my home.
- Javascript/Typescript - I myself don't like Typescript (career purpose only), but Javascript. ðŸ’µ 
- [![Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)]/[![Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/)] - Functional programming, concurrent programming, fault-tolerance, built-in memory cache, database, otp, easy to scale.
